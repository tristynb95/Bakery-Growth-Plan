                <p>This Privacy Policy describes how I, Tristen Bayley ("I," "me," or "my"), collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use the Bakery Growth Planner application (the "Service").</p>
                
                <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, I collect your email address and a securely hashed version of your password.</li>

                    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> I may collect technical information such as your IP address and browser type through the use of essential cookies and server logs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. How I Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>I use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To Provide and Manage the Service.</li>
                    <li>To Personalise Your Experience.</li>
                    <li>To Enable Sharing.</li>
                    <li>To Improve the Service.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
                <p>Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), my legal basis for processing your personal information is <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong>. I have a legitimate interest in providing and maintaining this Service to help you with your professional development and business planning. I have balanced this against your rights and freedoms and have concluded that your interests do not override this legitimate interest.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
                <p>I use a limited number of trusted third-party service providers to help me operate the Service. These are:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> I use Firebase for backend services, including secure user authentication and database hosting. Your data is stored on Firebase's secure servers in transit and at rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Netlify:</strong> The application is hosted on Netlify, which also provides the serverless functions used for secure API key handling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Fonts & Bootstrap Icons:</strong> These services are used to provide the fonts and icons you see in the application. They may receive your IP address in the course of providing their services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I will not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other third parties without your explicit consent, unless required by law.</p>

                <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
                <p>I am committed to protecting your personal information and have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures. These measures include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and at rest on the database servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure API Key Handling:</strong> I use secure serverless functions to manage the application's API keys, preventing them from being exposed to the public.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> I have a CSP in place to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Password Resets:</strong> The password reset functionality is designed to prevent user enumeration by providing a generic response regardless of whether an email address exists in the system.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>I will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as is necessary to fulfil the purposes I collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. You may delete your account and associated data at any time.</p>

                <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                <p>Under data protection law, you have the following rights:</p>

                        <li><strong>Your right to data portability</strong> - You have the right to ask that I transfer the personal information you gave me to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.</li>
                    </ul>

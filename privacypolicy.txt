4. Legal Basis for Processing

Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), my legal basis for processing your personal information is Legitimate Interests. I have a legitimate interest in providing and maintaining this Service to help you with your professional development and business planning. I have balanced this against your rights and freedoms and have concluded that your interests do not override this legitimate interest.

5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

I use a limited number of trusted third-party service providers to help me operate the Service. These are:

Google Firebase: I use Firebase for backend services, including secure user authentication and database hosting. Your data is stored on Firebase's secure servers in transit and at rest.

Netlify: The application is hosted on Netlify, which also provides the serverless functions used for secure API key handling.

Google Fonts & Bootstrap Icons: These services are used to provide the fonts and icons you see in the application. They may receive your IP address in the course of providing their services.

I will not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other third parties without your explicit consent, unless required by law.

6. Data Security

I am committed to protecting your personal information and have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures. These measures include:

Encryption: Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and at rest on the database servers.

Secure API Key Handling: I use secure serverless functions to manage the application's API keys, preventing them from being exposed to the public.

Content Security Policy (CSP): I have a CSP in place to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.

Secure Password Resets: The password reset functionality is designed to prevent user enumeration by providing a generic response regardless of whether an email address exists in the system.

7. Data Retention

I will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as is necessary to fulfil the purposes I collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. You may delete your account and associated data at any time.

// This script has been refactored into the following modules:
// - main.js: The main application entry point and orchestrator.
// - api.js: Handles all communication with backend services and APIs.
// - auth.js: Manages user authentication, login, and session control.
// - dashboard.js: Controls the rendering and interaction of the main dashboard.
// - plan-view.js: Handles the display and data management for individual plan views.
// - calendar.js: Contains all logic for the calendar feature.
// - ui.js: Manages shared UI components like modals, menus, and notifications.

// The old code is preserved in the git history. The application now runs via main.js.
